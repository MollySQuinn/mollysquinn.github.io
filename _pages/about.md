I'm a final-year PhD Candidate in Computer Science at University College Dublin with a background in Experimental Psychology.  

My research is interdisciplinary in nature, using techniques from both psychology and computer science.  In psychology, I study how people think about and predict unexpected events, and how features of prior events such as sentiment and controllability influence these judgments. For this work, I have received an Early Career Publication Award from the European Society for Cognitive Psychology which is awarded to one PhD student and one post-doc per year.  On the computational side, I am currently using the transformer language models BERT and GPT-2 to model human behaviour using the data I collected. 

More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in how people reason and make decisions in real-world contexts, and how we can leverage advances in data analytics and machine learning to better understand these phenomena.  Likewise, I am interested in explainable AI that is well-informed by what we know about the people that use AI systems.

I will be graduating in Fall 2022, so please contact me if you think I would be a good fit for your lab or company!
