After spending most of my academic career in experimental cognitive psychology, I moved into computer science to study large language models (LLMs) and explainable AI (XAI). My Ph.D. covered topics including how people predict unexpected events and how LLMs (in 2020) compared to human cognition in everyday scenarios.

Now in industry, I currently work as a Sr. Data Scientist at Target, a Fortune 500 retail company in the US. My team supports inventory accuracy on the salesfloor using machine learning models to predict unknown out of stock items.

In my free time, I write about human experience with generative AI - particularly LLMs. Follow this space to see new posts!
