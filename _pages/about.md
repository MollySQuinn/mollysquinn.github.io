I currently work as a Sr. Data Scientist at Target, a Fortune 500 retail company in the US. My team supports inventory accuracy on the salesfloor using machine learning models to predict unknown out of stock items.

In my free time, I write about human experience with generative AI - particularly LLMs. Follow this space to see new posts!
